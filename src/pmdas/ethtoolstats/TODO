If we do the stats like ring, pause params., we might as well rename the extension to 'ethtool'

- Also export ethtool -g stats? (Ring sizes)

- Pause parameters?

- version: 1.78.17-0
firmware-version: bc 6.2.25 phy 4.f
bus-info: 0000:18:00.1

- Write a testcase

- Need to cater for module addition and removal after pmcd start

- Cluster together within a table all the metrics that share an indom
  so either a table that shows all the metrics shared by the same indom.
  Like: eth0: network.interface.in.bytes, network.interface.mtu, ...

- Test start/end time

- Test sample interval

- Override the -a argument and also allow a single file parameter?

- Measure performance of parsing and creating pdf and jot down
  the biggest time-consuming culprits. Consider CYTHON for some
  functions?

- How to visualize stuff with a truckload of instances like the case
  when we collect proc.* with the proc pmda

- proc.nprocs does not have a dedicated index entry?

- Add the possibility to add correlation time entries

- the description of the metric is not printed

- Make use of the convenience pmcc.py class

- Work on moving some of the basic archive parsing functionality
  in the pcp python bindings themselves

- Add a default set of custom graphs that are always automatically included

- Verify that all the maths in rate conversion are always correct

- Like sarstats make it multiprocess for faster processing ? The archive
  parsing could be done by splitting the whole time interval by the nr of
  the CPUs and each could have an archive reading process

- In the progress bar add a % of completion (we know start_time and end_time, so it should be easy)

- Run the code through pylint and pyflake

- Add test cases that exercise all possible command arguments

- Have the possibility to use a config file to customize how the pdf looks

- Fix setup.py and test the packaging

- Test it with ex4 archives
  
- Add on ex4 the monitoring and collection of per process data and
  test a pdf creation with that

- Add bash autocompletion

- There is a plan to add a mode to libpcp on archive context creation
  where it will open a directory (like code here wishes to) and produce
  a context which sources data from all archives in that directory.
  When that work is tackled, it may simplify the mode you have here
  (planned?) where it scans a directory for pcp archives.
  [Michele] This needs revisiting when this code appears upstream
